        <p id="tribute-info" class="intro">Ray and Charles Eames were the sunny side of the cold war and the fun side of the industrial-military complex. Their designs and imagery conveyed modernism without fear, industry without pollution, science without the Bomb. They portrayed themselves as a happier, more progressive version of the couple in American Gothic: homespun, steadfast, radiating work ethic. He was handsome as a Hollywood war hero, she wore farm-girl pinafores and practical tied-up hair. They could design chairs, buildings, magazine covers, multi-screen video installations, textiles, exhibitions and medical aids. They effortlessly coupled new technologies of fiberglass and aluminum with the arts-and-crafts spirit of William Morris. They were undogmatic and (mostly) practical. A prototype plywood glider suffered a fatal crash and never went into production, but the leg splint they designed in the same material saved the limbs and lives of thousands of injured US military.

          <p class="intro">Ray and Charles Eames occupy an unequalled position in the pantheon of design. They combined polymathic genius with specialist knowledge, and craft with technology to a degree that no one else has found possible before or since. They inhabited a phase in time when the empire of mass-produced objects was reaching its peak, just before it would concede to the empire of mass media, and they thrived on both. In their furniture and graphics they are children of the Bauhaus; in their use of multiple media and imagery they are parents of Silicon Valley. They didn’t just make things; they communicated.

          <p class="intro">Almost everyone knows their chairs, even if they couldn’t name them – creations in aluminium, fibreglass, aluminium, leather, plywood, wood and steel that combine generous, body-hugging curves with structures of improbable spindliness. They serve multiple purposes and take many forms, from executive swivel chairs, sheeny and controlled as Don Draper’s hair, to armchairs of deep enveloping comfort, to a chaise longue that looks like modernist sculpture, to chirpy dining chairs for schools and restaurants. They didn’t create one or two design classics, as others have, but several.

          <p class="intro-left">Sam Jacob comments on Eames furniture “seems somehow to remain always slightly apart from the space it inhabits”, yet it is capable of acting in an ensemble, of contributing to an interior in collaboration with heterogeneous compositions of other elements. It allows customization and transformation, with different fabrics, colors and animal skins, or with the witty line drawings of cats and naked bodies that the Eameses’ friend, the illustrator and cartoonist Saul Steinberg, added to some of the chairs’ seats and backs.

          <p class="intro">In 1959 Ray and Charles Eames presented Glimpses of the USA, a seven-screen hymn to happy suburban life, at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, as part of the American government’s effort to impress its nation’s superiority on Soviet citizens. Their most memorable film was 1977’s Powers of Ten, which zooms in and out from a couple lying on a picnic rug in a Chicago park. It progresses via an aerial view of Lake Michigan, the solar system and our galaxy to the blackness of the universe, and descends to a pointilliste fuzz of subatomic particles.

            <p class="p-top">Designed in 1948, the DSR has a distinctive chrome base, giving it the nickname the “Eiffel” chair. It was one of a series, all with the same seat shell, made at first from fibreglass and now, less satisfyingly, from polypropylene. The DSW has a wooden base, the DAW and DAR are armchairs (either with a wooden or rod base) and the RAR (my favourite) is a rocking armchair with a rod base. The original colours were greige, elephant hide grey, parchment and seafoam green.</p>

          <div class="floatnone"> 
            <p class="p-top">As storage goes, this is as cool as it gets. Eames storage units are multipurpose and freestanding, with moulded plywood sliding doors, brightly painted screens, brushed, galvanised metal surfaces, and height-adjustable legs – and they work as room dividers just as well as they work as shelves. I’ve chosen the now rather rare ESU 426-C (1954). I love the way its beautiful birch drawers (11 of them, rather than 10 or 12) seem to look back to what your granny would have called a sideboard, even as its Mondrian-esque panels of red, yellow, grey and black gaze hopefully into the future.</p>

            <p class="p-top">In 1949, the husband-and-wife team of Charles and Ray Eames built a home for themselves in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. Constructed of steel, the house is starkly avant-garde from the outside: it resembles, from a distance, a painting by Mondrian. But its interior is richly decorated with things the couple collected on their travels: mobiles, rush baskets, Native American art, Japanese dolls. The Eameses made their house the centre of their world, and lived there until their deaths (Charles in 1978, Ray a decade later). The house is now a US National Historic Landmark and open to visitors.</p>

          <div class="floatnone"> 
            <p class="p-top">I defy anyone to find a seat more comfortable than the Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman, released in 1956 for the Herman Miller furniture company. Charles Eames’s vision was for something that had the “warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman’s mitt”, and the result was this blissful embrace of a chair in moulded plywood and leather. Now part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art, I regret more than I can say the fact that I’ve come to associate it with Peter Mandelson, who was famously photographed disporting himself in one at home in Notting Hill in 1999.</p>

          <div class="floatnone"> 
            <p class="p-top">In 1999, Time magazine declared the LCW the greatest design of the 20th century. The original LCW was born in 1945, of Charles’s work designing plywood splints for the US air force, using curves to mimic the shape of the human leg. After several experiments – plywood split if bent too much – Charles and Ray came up with a model using two separate pieces of plywood joined by a plywood spine. The dream of a single-shell chair was over (Charles and Eero Saarinen had entered one in a competition in 1940, covering any cracks with upholstery). In its place was an “honest” ergonomic chair that was soon coveted the world over.</p>

            <p class="p-top">These coat hooks, made using techniques developed for the wire-framed chairs and tables, were designed by Charles and Ray in 1953 to encourage children to hang things up. Naturally they’ve long since been colonised by adults who lack the cash to fill their houses with Eames furniture but love the aesthetic all the same. Playful and strong, Hang-It-All reminds you, in a glance, that unlike so many 20th-century designers, the Eameses were not sombre, monochrome-obsessed types. “Take your pleasure seriously,” said Charles, by which he meant, among other things: even those who wear black polo necks are entitled to have a good time.</p>

            <p class="p-top">Who sits on a wire chair? A man in “difficult” spectacles who fusses about how his espresso is made, and owns 10 shirts all of the same colour and design. Strange, then, that this is an Eames creation. The Eameses were mostly great fun, as you may tell from the famous photograph they took of themselves in which they look to have been pinned to a wall like a couple of insect specimens. They liked jokes, games and collecting things; Ray, in particular, was too much of a hoarder ever to pass as a minimalist. The wire chair (1951) is certainly not a joke. It is, in fact, no fun at all. But it sure looks good against a concrete wall or hard wood floor.</p>

            <p class="p-top">The original House of Cards, made in 1952, had two decks: the picture deck and the pattern deck. The images are of what the toy-loving Eameses called “good stuff... familiar and nostalgic objects from the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms”. Thanks to six slots on each card, they can be joined together to make towers and bridges, houses and apartment blocks. At about £15 for a small set (they also come in large), this is definitely the most affordable way to invite the Eames aesthetic into your home – though prepare to be irritated when your guests, unable to resist, begin dismantling your witty constructions and replacing them with their own.</p>

The Aluminum Group chair went into production in 1958 but has a timeless quality. Not to be confused with its near relative the Lobby chair (1960), designed for the Time-Life building in New York, which Bobby Fischer insisted on sitting on during the 1972 world chess championship in Reykjavik. Furniture firm Herman Miller duly dispatched one for Fischer, and for his opponent, Boris Spassky.</p>

            <p class="p-top">This chair, designed for a competition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948, was inspired by Floating Figure, a 1927 nude in bronze by the French-American sculptor Gaston Lachaise. Made of fibreglass on a base of steel and oak, it is in many ways an uncharacteristic Eames design, being so much more beautiful than it is comfortable; it also proved too expensive to produce until the 1990s when Vitra finally began its manufacture. For those who have space enough for chairs that need never be used, it’s an exquisite statement piece. But for anyone else it’s (literally) a pain in the backside.</p>
